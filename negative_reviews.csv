I hated this film. The character development was non-existent and motivations unclear.
A poor attempt at filmmaking. The pacing was all wrong and scenes felt disconnected.
This film is a complete disaster. Amateur hour from start to finish.
Save your money and skip this one. Nothing redeeming about it at all.
The director should be embarrassed. This was a mess from start to finish.
I want my two hours back. This movie was painfully bad.
The plot had so many holes you could drive a truck through it.
"Terrible acting, awful script, and amateur direction. A total failure."
This movie tries too hard and fails miserably at everything it attempts.
I've seen better acting in student films. This was embarrassing.
The special effects looked like they were from the 1990s. Laughably bad.
None of the characters were likeable or believable. Just awful.
A pretentious mess that thinks it's smarter than it actually is.
